# Chapter 10: The Animal Kingdom

## Introduction to Animals

Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms that are heterotrophic, meaning they obtain nutrients by consuming other organisms. They are the most diverse kingdom of organisms, with over 1.5 million known species.

## Invertebrates

**Invertebrates** are animals that do not have a backbone. They make up over 95% of all animal species. Some of the major groups of invertebrates include:

*   **Sponges:** The simplest animals, with no true tissues or organs.
*   **Cnidarians:** Include jellyfish, corals, and sea anemones. They have stinging cells called cnidocytes.
*   **Worms:** Include flatworms, roundworms, and segmented worms.
*   **Mollusks:** Include snails, clams, and squids. They have a soft body and a hard shell.
*   **Arthropods:** The largest group of animals, including insects, spiders, and crustaceans. They have a segmented body, a hard exoskeleton, and jointed appendages.
*   **Echinoderms:** Include starfish, sea urchins, and sand dollars. They have a spiny skin and a water vascular system.

## Vertebrates

**Vertebrates** are animals that have a backbone. They include:

*   **Fishes:** The first vertebrates, they are aquatic and have gills for breathing.
*   **Amphibians:** Include frogs, toads, and salamanders. They live in water as larvae and on land as adults.
*   **Reptiles:** Include snakes, lizards, turtles, and crocodiles. They have scales and lay eggs on land.
*   **Birds:** Have feathers and are adapted for flight.
*   **Mammals:** Have hair or fur and produce milk to feed their young.
