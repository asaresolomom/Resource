# Chapter 11: Human Anatomy and Physiology

## Skeletal and Muscular Systems

The **skeletal system** provides support and protection for the body, and allows for movement. It consists of bones, cartilage, ligaments, and tendons. The **muscular system** is responsible for movement. It consists of three types of muscle tissue: skeletal muscle, smooth muscle, and cardiac muscle.

## Nervous System

The **nervous system** is the body's control center. It consists of the brain, spinal cord, and nerves. The nervous system is responsible for receiving and processing information from the environment, and for sending signals to the muscles and glands.

## Endocrine System

The **endocrine system** is a system of glands that produce and secrete hormones. Hormones are chemical messengers that regulate a variety of bodily functions, such as growth, metabolism, and reproduction.

## Circulatory and Respiratory Systems

The **circulatory system** transports oxygen, nutrients, and hormones to the cells of the body, and removes waste products. It consists of the heart, blood vessels, and blood. The **respiratory system** is responsible for taking in oxygen and releasing carbon dioxide. It consists of the lungs, trachea, and diaphragm.

## Digestive and Excretory Systems

The **digestive system** breaks down food into smaller molecules that can be absorbed by the body. It consists of the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, and large intestine. The **excretory system** removes waste products from the body. It consists of the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra.

## Immune System

The **immune system** protects the body from disease. It consists of a variety of cells, tissues, and organs that work together to identify and destroy foreign invaders, such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi.

## Reproductive System

The **reproductive system** is responsible for producing offspring. The male reproductive system consists of the testes, penis, and scrotum. The female reproductive system consists of the ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, and vagina.
