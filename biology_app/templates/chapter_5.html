# Chapter 5: Cell Division

## The Cell Cycle

The **cell cycle** is the series of events that take place in a cell leading to its division and duplication of its DNA (DNA replication) to produce two daughter cells. The cell cycle is divided into two main phases:

*   **Interphase:** The longest phase of the cell cycle, during which the cell grows, replicates its DNA, and prepares for division. Interphase is further divided into three subphases: G1, S, and G2.
*   **M phase (Mitotic phase):** The phase of the cell cycle during which the cell divides. The M phase consists of two main processes: mitosis and cytokinesis.

## Mitosis

**Mitosis** is the process by which a eukaryotic cell separates the chromosomes in its cell nucleus into two identical sets in two daughter nuclei. Mitosis is divided into four stages:

1.  **Prophase:** The chromosomes condense and become visible, the nuclear envelope breaks down, and the spindle fibers form.
2.  **Metaphase:** The chromosomes line up at the metaphase plate (the center of the cell).
3.  **Anaphase:** The sister chromatids separate and are pulled to opposite poles of the cell.
4.  **Telophase:** The chromosomes decondense, the nuclear envelope reforms, and the spindle fibers disappear.

## Meiosis

**Meiosis** is a special type of cell division that reduces the number of chromosomes in the parent cell by half and produces four gamete cells. Meiosis is required for sexual reproduction. Meiosis consists of two rounds of division: Meiosis I and Meiosis II.

## Regulation of the Cell Cycle

The cell cycle is controlled by a number of checkpoints that ensure that the cell is ready to divide. These checkpoints are regulated by proteins called cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). If a cell does not pass a checkpoint, it may enter a resting state (G0) or undergo apoptosis (programmed cell death).
