# Chapter 7: Evolution

## Darwin's Theory of Evolution

**Evolution** is the change in the heritable characteristics of biological populations over successive generations. **Charles Darwin's** theory of evolution by natural selection is the foundation of modern evolutionary theory.

Darwin's theory is based on four key observations:

1.  **Overproduction:** Organisms produce more offspring than can survive.
2.  **Variation:** There is variation among individuals within a population.
3.  **Competition:** Organisms compete for limited resources.
4.  **Survival of the Fittest:** Individuals with traits that are best suited to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce.

## Evidence for Evolution

There is a vast amount of evidence that supports the theory of evolution, including:

*   **The fossil record:** Fossils show that life on Earth has changed over time.
*   **Comparative anatomy:** Homologous structures (structures that are similar in different species because they were inherited from a common ancestor) and vestigial structures (structures that have no apparent function but are residual parts from a past ancestor) provide evidence of common ancestry.
*   **Comparative embryology:** The early stages of development of different species are very similar, which suggests that they share a common ancestor.
*   **Biogeography:** The geographic distribution of species provides evidence of evolution.
*   **Molecular biology:** Similarities in DNA and protein sequences between different species provide evidence of common ancestry.

## Mechanisms of Evolution

Natural selection is not the only mechanism of evolution. Other mechanisms include:

*   **Genetic drift:** Random changes in the allele frequencies of a population.
*   **Gene flow:** The transfer of alleles from one population to another.
*   **Mutation:** A change in the DNA sequence of an organism.

## Speciation

**Speciation** is the evolutionary process by which new biological species arise. Speciation can occur in two main ways:

*   **Allopatric speciation:** A new species forms when a population is geographically isolated from the parent population.
*   **Sympatric speciation:** A new species forms without geographic isolation.
