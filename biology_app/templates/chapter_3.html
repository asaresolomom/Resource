# Chapter 3: Cell Structure and Function

## The Cell Theory

The cell theory is a fundamental principle of biology that states:

1.  All living things are composed of one or more cells.
2.  Cells are the basic units of structure and function in living things.
3.  New cells are produced from existing cells.

## Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic Cells

There are two main types of cells:

*   **Prokaryotic cells:** These are simple cells that do not have a nucleus or other membrane-bound organelles. They are found in bacteria and archaea.
*   **Eukaryotic cells:** These are more complex cells that have a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles. They are found in plants, animals, fungi, and protists.

## Organelles and their Functions

Eukaryotic cells contain a variety of **organelles**, which are specialized structures that perform specific functions. Some of the most important organelles include:

*   **Nucleus:** Contains the cell's genetic material (DNA) and controls the cell's activities.
*   **Ribosomes:** Synthesize proteins.
*   **Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER):** A network of membranes that is involved in protein and lipid synthesis. There are two types of ER: rough ER (with ribosomes) and smooth ER (without ribosomes).
*   **Golgi Apparatus:** Modifies, sorts, and packages proteins and other materials from the ER for storage in the cell or secretion outside the cell.
*   **Mitochondria:** The "powerhouses" of the cell, where cellular respiration occurs and ATP (the cell's main energy currency) is produced.
*   **Chloroplasts:** Found in plant cells and some protists, chloroplasts are the site of photosynthesis.
*   **Vacuoles:** Store water, salts, proteins, and carbohydrates.
*   **Lysosomes:** Contain enzymes that break down lipids, carbohydrates, and proteins into small molecules that can be used by the rest of the cell.
*   **Cytoskeleton:** A network of protein filaments that helps the cell to maintain its shape and is involved in many forms of cell movement.

## The Cell Membrane and Transport

The **cell membrane** is a thin, flexible barrier that surrounds all cells. It is composed of a lipid bilayer with embedded proteins. The cell membrane is selectively permeable, meaning it allows some substances to pass through but not others.

There are two main types of transport across the cell membrane:

*   **Passive transport:** Does not require energy. It includes diffusion, osmosis, and facilitated diffusion.
*   **Active transport:** Requires energy. It includes protein pumps, endocytosis, and exocytosis.
