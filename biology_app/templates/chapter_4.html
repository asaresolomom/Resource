# Chapter 4: Energy and Metabolism

## Energy and Thermodynamics

**Energy** is the ability to do work. In living organisms, energy is required for growth, movement, reproduction, and all other life processes. The study of energy transformations is called **thermodynamics**.

There are two laws of thermodynamics that are particularly important in biology:

*   **First Law of Thermodynamics:** Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred or transformed.
*   **Second Law of Thermodynamics:** Every energy transfer or transformation increases the entropy (disorder) of the universe.

## Enzymes and Enzyme Regulation

**Enzymes** are proteins that act as biological catalysts, speeding up chemical reactions without being consumed in the reaction. Enzymes are highly specific, meaning they only catalyze one or a few types of reactions.

The activity of enzymes can be regulated in several ways, including:

*   **Competitive inhibition:** A molecule similar to the substrate binds to the active site of the enzyme, preventing the substrate from binding.
*   **Noncompetitive inhibition:** A molecule binds to a site on the enzyme other than the active site, changing the shape of the active site and making it less effective.
*   **Allosteric regulation:** The binding of a molecule to a specific site on an enzyme (the allosteric site) either activates or inhibits the enzyme's activity.

## Cellular Respiration

**Cellular respiration** is the process by which cells break down glucose and other organic molecules to produce ATP, the main energy currency of the cell. There are three main stages of cellular respiration:

1.  **Glycolysis:** Occurs in the cytoplasm and breaks down glucose into two molecules of pyruvate.
2.  **Krebs Cycle (Citric Acid Cycle):** Occurs in the mitochondria and completes the breakdown of glucose.
3.  **Electron Transport Chain:** Occurs in the mitochondria and uses the energy from the breakdown of glucose to produce a large amount of ATP.

## Photosynthesis

**Photosynthesis** is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to create their own food in the form of glucose. Photosynthesis occurs in the chloroplasts and consists of two main stages:

1.  **Light-dependent reactions:** Occur in the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplasts and use sunlight to produce ATP and NADPH.
2.  **Light-independent reactions (Calvin Cycle):** Occur in the stroma of the chloroplasts and use the ATP and NADPH from the light-dependent reactions to produce glucose from carbon dioxide.
