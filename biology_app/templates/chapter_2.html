# Chapter 2: The Chemical Basis of Life

## Atoms, Elements, and Compounds

All matter, including living organisms, is composed of **atoms**, the smallest unit of an element that retains the properties of that element. An **element** is a pure substance that consists entirely of one type of atom. The most common elements in living organisms are carbon (C), hydrogen (H), oxygen (O), and nitrogen (N).

A **compound** is a substance formed by the chemical combination of two or more elements in definite proportions. For example, water (H₂O) is a compound made of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.

## Chemical Bonds

Atoms in compounds are held together by **chemical bonds**. There are two main types of chemical bonds:

*   **Covalent bonds:** Formed when electrons are shared between atoms.
*   **Ionic bonds:** Formed when one or more electrons are transferred from one atom to another.

## Water and its Properties

Water is a polar molecule, meaning it has a slight positive charge on one end and a slight negative charge on the other. This polarity allows water to form hydrogen bonds with other water molecules, which gives it several unique properties that are essential for life:

*   **Cohesion and Adhesion:** Water molecules stick to each other (cohesion) and to other substances (adhesion).
*   **High Specific Heat:** Water can absorb a large amount of heat before its temperature changes significantly.
*   **High Heat of Vaporization:** Water requires a large amount of heat to evaporate.
*   **Universal Solvent:** Water can dissolve a wide variety of substances.
*   **Density of Ice:** Solid water (ice) is less dense than liquid water, which is why ice floats.

## Macromolecules: Carbohydrates, Lipids, Proteins, Nucleic Acids

Living organisms are made up of large, complex molecules called **macromolecules**. There are four main types of macromolecules:

*   **Carbohydrates:** Made of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, carbohydrates are the main source of energy for living things. They include simple sugars like glucose and complex carbohydrates like starch and cellulose.
*   **Lipids:** Made mostly of carbon and hydrogen, lipids are used to store energy, form cell membranes, and act as chemical messengers. They include fats, oils, and waxes.
*   **Proteins:** Made of amino acids, proteins have a wide variety of functions, including acting as enzymes, providing structural support, and transporting substances.
*   **Nucleic Acids:** Made of nucleotides, nucleic acids store and transmit genetic information. The two types of nucleic acids are deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA).
