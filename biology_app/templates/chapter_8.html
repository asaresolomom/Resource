# Chapter 8: Classification of Living Things

## Taxonomy and Systematics

**Taxonomy** is the science of naming, defining, and classifying groups of biological organisms on the basis of shared characteristics. **Systematics** is the study of the diversification of living forms, both past and present, and the relationships among living things through time.

The modern system of classification was developed by **Carolus Linnaeus**. It is a hierarchical system that consists of the following levels (from broadest to most specific):

1.  Domain
2.  Kingdom
3.  Phylum
4.  Class
5.  Order
6.  Family
7.  Genus
8.  Species

## The Three Domains of Life

All living organisms can be classified into one of three **domains**:

1.  **Bacteria:** Prokaryotic organisms that are found in a wide variety of environments.
2.  **Archaea:** Prokaryotic organisms that are often found in extreme environments, such as hot springs and salt lakes.
3.  **Eukarya:** Eukaryotic organisms, including plants, animals, fungi, and protists.

## Viruses

**Viruses** are non-living infectious agents that can only replicate inside the living cells of other organisms. Viruses are not classified in any of the three domains of life because they are not considered to be living organisms.
