# Chapter 12: Ecology

## Introduction to Ecology

**Ecology** is the scientific study of the interactions between organisms and their environment. The environment includes both biotic (living) and abiotic (non-living) factors.

## Populations

A **population** is a group of individuals of the same species that live in the same area. Ecologists study the size, density, and distribution of populations.

## Communities and Ecosystems

A **community** is all the different populations of different species that live and interact in the same area. An **ecosystem** is a community of organisms and their physical environment.

## Biomes

A **biome** is a large, naturally occurring community of flora and fauna occupying a major habitat, e.g., forest or tundra. The distribution of biomes is determined by climate, especially temperature and precipitation.

## Conservation Biology

**Conservation biology** is the scientific study of the nature and of Earth's biodiversity with the aim of protecting species, their habitats, and ecosystems from excessive rates of extinction and the erosion of biotic interactions.
