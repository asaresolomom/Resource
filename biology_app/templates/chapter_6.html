# Chapter 6: Genetics

## Mendelian Genetics

**Genetics** is the study of heredity and the variation of inherited characteristics. **Gregor Mendel**, through his work on pea plants, discovered the fundamental principles of heredity. He deduced that genes come in pairs and are inherited as distinct units, one from each parent.

Mendel's principles include:

*   **The Law of Segregation:** The two alleles for a heritable character separate (segregate) during gamete formation and end up in different gametes.
*   **The Law of Independent Assortment:** Each pair of alleles segregates independently of each other pair of alleles during gamete formation.

## Extensions of Mendelian Genetics

Not all patterns of inheritance can be explained by Mendelian genetics. Some extensions of Mendelian genetics include:

*   **Incomplete dominance:** The phenotype of the heterozygote is intermediate between the phenotypes of the two homozygotes.
*   **Codominance:** Both alleles for a gene are fully expressed in the heterozygote.
*   **Multiple alleles:** A gene has more than two alleles.
*   **Polygenic inheritance:** A single trait is controlled by two or more genes.

## Human Genetics

Human genetics is the study of inheritance as it occurs in human beings. Many human traits, such as eye color and blood type, are inherited in a Mendelian fashion. Other human traits, such as height and intelligence, are influenced by multiple genes and environmental factors.

## DNA Structure and Replication

**Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)** is the molecule that carries the genetic instructions for the development, functioning, growth, and reproduction of all known organisms and many viruses. DNA has a double helix structure, with two strands of nucleotides wound around each other.

**DNA replication** is the process by which a double-stranded DNA molecule is copied to produce two identical DNA molecules.

## Protein Synthesis

**Protein synthesis** is the process by which cells make proteins. It occurs in two stages:

1.  **Transcription:** The genetic information in DNA is copied into a complementary strand of messenger RNA (mRNA).
2.  **Translation:** The genetic information in mRNA is used to synthesize a protein.
