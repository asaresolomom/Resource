# Chapter 9: The Plant Kingdom

## Introduction to Plants

Plants are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms that are characterized by their ability to perform photosynthesis. They are essential to life on Earth, as they produce oxygen and are the primary producers in most ecosystems.

## Plant Tissues and Organs

Plants have three main types of tissues:

*   **Dermal tissue:** The outer protective layer of the plant.
*   **Vascular tissue:** Transports water, minerals, and nutrients throughout the plant. It consists of two types of tissue: xylem and phloem.
*   **Ground tissue:** The tissue that makes up the bulk of the plant. It is involved in photosynthesis, storage, and support.

Plants also have three main organs:

*   **Roots:** Anchor the plant in the ground and absorb water and minerals from the soil.
*   **Stems:** Support the plant and transport water, minerals, and nutrients between the roots and leaves.
*   **Leaves:** The primary site of photosynthesis.

## Plant Reproduction

Plants can reproduce both sexually and asexually.

*   **Sexual reproduction:** Involves the fusion of male and female gametes to produce a zygote. In flowering plants, the male gametes are contained in pollen and the female gametes are contained in the ovules.
*   **Asexual reproduction:** Does not involve the fusion of gametes. It can occur through a variety of methods, such as budding, fragmentation, and vegetative propagation.

## Plant Responses to Stimuli

Plants can respond to a variety of stimuli, such as light, gravity, and touch. These responses are called **tropisms**.
